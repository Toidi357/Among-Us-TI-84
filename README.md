# Among-Us-TI-84

###This TI-Basic program draws an among us figure on the graph

I did not create the equations for the among us, I found them here https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yhvlhczzjb and simply translated them onto a TI-84. The program is not fully optimized (yet???) if anyone wants to try and optimize it please do so :) :) :) :)

To import, download the TI Connect CE application on their website and load the SUS.8xp program
